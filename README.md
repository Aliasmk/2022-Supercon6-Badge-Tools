# Welcome to the 2022 Hackaday Supercon6 Badge

Whether you're looking for cool example code to flash into your badge, or an assembler/disassembler to help you do so, you're in the right place!  

## Assembler / Disassembler

Back in 2020, when we thought we were going to have a Supercon in Belgrade, Mike Szczys wrote an assembler and disassembler for the first versions of the badge.  

While you can input programs directly, comments and a nice provision for subroutines makes life a lot more navigable.  Learning to use the assembler is a great next step along your journey.

It only requires Python, so if that's already installed, you're good to go.  But note that we also have the same assembler hosted online for your convenience.

## Example Code

We've written a few examples, blinky and otherwise, to help you on your way.  But you're going to write your masterwork as well.  Save it in a subdirectory prefixed by your handle like "coolHacker1337-super_blinker" with whatever documentation you want to add, and submit a pull request.  We'll get it posted here for all to enjoy!  

## Emulator

Why would you emulate a badge that you have in your hands?  Well, it _does_ make for a faster code, test, code cycle.  So far, we have gotten most of the core functionality of the badge working, but buttons and how to think about IO are still a work in progress.  Hack away!
