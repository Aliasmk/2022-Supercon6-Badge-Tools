# Welcome to the 2022 Hackaday Supercon6 Badge

Whether you're looking for cool example code to flash into your badge, or an assembler/disassembler to help you do so, you're in the right place!  

## Assembler / Disassembler

Back in 2020, when we thought we were going to have a Supercon in Belgrade, Mike Szczys wrote an assembler and disassembler for the first versions of the badge.  

While you can input programs directly, comments and a nice provision for subroutines makes life a lot more navigable.  Learning to use the assembler is a great next step along your journey.

If you don't have Python installed, you can also run the same assembler in the cloud.  (Fluffy!)  http://cloud.wd5gnr.com/badgeasm/


## Example Code

We've written a few examples, blinky and otherwise, to help you on your way.  But you're going to write your masterwork as well.  Save it in a subdirectory prefixed by your handle like "coolHacker1337-super_blinker" with whatever documentation you want to add, and submit a pull request.  We'll get it posted here for all to enjoy!  

## Software

If you've written any computer-side software tools that will help others work with the badge, open up a subdirectory here and shoot us a pull request!


## Emulator

Why would you emulate a badge that you have in your hands?  Well, it _does_ make for a faster code, test, code cycle.  So far, we have gotten most of the core functionality of the badge working, but buttons and how to think about IO are still a work in progress.  Hack away!
